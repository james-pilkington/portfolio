I played a key role in the end-to-end execution of the Campus division's major POS system migration. Over an 18-month project lifecycle, we transitioned from an iOS-based point-of-sale system to a scalable Android-based platform leveraging ELO hardware.

I combined technical project management skills with subject matter expertise in campus dining to shape product direction, managing cross-functional collaboration and external hardware partners.
