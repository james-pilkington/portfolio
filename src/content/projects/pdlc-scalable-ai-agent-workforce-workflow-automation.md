Designed as an experimental "force multiplier," I engineered a digital workforce of specialized AI agents interacting in concert to handle end-to-end Product Development Life Cycle (PDLC) flows. By integrating custom LLM logic with external API triggers, I created a system capable of complex, sequential handoffs.

The workflow begins with a **PM Agent** handling research and discovery, which passes specs to a **Dev Agent** for implementation. This triggers simultaneous downstream actions: a **QA Agent** performs continuous 24/7 testing, while a **PMM Agent** generates launch-ready marketing assets. While not intended to replace human oversight entirely, this project demonstrates how guardrail-guided AI can solve repetitive tasks, creating a continuous operational loop that dramatically reduces lead time.
