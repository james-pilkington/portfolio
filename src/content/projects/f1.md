I designed and engineered a "living" data product that predicts Formula 1 qualifying results using historical telemetry data. Unlike static dashboards, this application features a fully autonomous MLOps pipeline that self-updates and re-trains its predictive models weekly without human intervention.

Key Achievements:

* End-to-End Data Engineering: Built a robust ETL pipeline extracting data from the FastF1 API, processing thousands of lap times into a compressed Parquet data store.
* Predictive Modeling: Trained a Gradient Boosting Regressor to predict qualifying grid positions based on Free Practice pace and teammate deltas, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of ~3 positions.
* Automated MLOps: Architected a GitHub Actions workflow to run weekly CRON jobs that fetch new race data, retrain the AI model on the latest trends, and auto-deploy the updated application.
* Scenario Analysis: Created an interactive "What-If" simulation tool allowing users to manipulate variables (e.g., "sandbagging" in practice) to test the model's logic.
