  On a personal note I enjoy giving to the tech and product communities through fractional volunteering and community engagement. Through organizations such as Develop4Good, I have led student product teams to guide them through covic engagement proejcts. 

  On a lighter note I enjoy filling my free time wiht Archery, Skiing or watching F1!
