intro_body: |
  I specialize in building scalable Product Ops foundations and turning complex enterprise needs into measurable outcomes. I’ve led 0→1 product launches, influenced multi-million dollar revenue, and partnered with executive teams to improve how products are built, launched, and adopted. My strength lies in systems thinking, people leadership, and using data to drive clarity and momentum across teams.

  This site showcases selected projects and experiments I’ve built to sharpen my technical, AI, and UI skills, and to demonstrate how I think about product problems end to end.

  If you’re interested in Product Ops, product leadership, or building scalable systems that serve both customers and teams, I’d love to connect. And if you have a great book or course recommendation, I’m always learning.
